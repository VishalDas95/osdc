             <h3> Q. How Mozilla Punjab started?</h3>
             <p> So we weren’t Mozilla Punjab from the beginning, when we were null, we called ourselves Open Source Developers. Eventually we started exploring the world of Open Source and Mozilla, and that’s how we came around Mozilla Communities. We reached out to Mozilla India and talked to them about starting a Campus Club since we were just students learning about Open Source but, they offered us to start a regional chapter as Mozilla Punjab, so we could bring all the Universities under one umbrella, and make a bigger community! So hey if you made this far, come in and join us and be a part of this amazing Open Community of Punjab!<br></p>
            <h3>Q. What is the aim of Mozilla?</h3>
            <p>Our mission is to ensure the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all. An Internet that truly puts people first, where individuals can shape their own experience and are empowered, safe and independent.
                    <br>
                    At Mozilla, we’re a global community of technologists, thinkers and builders working together to keep the Internet alive and accessible, so people worldwide can be informed contributors and creators of the Web. We believe this act of human collaboration across an open platform is essential to individual growth and our collective future.
